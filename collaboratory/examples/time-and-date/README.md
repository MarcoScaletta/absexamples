# Dates and Times in ABS

This is a short example on how to convert ABS logical clock values as calendar dates and times.  See <http://abs-models.org/documentation/examples/time-and-date/> for a description.

Start the model with `make run`, then open <http://localhost:8080/>; you will see a line diagram with random values plotted over four days, with a value every six hours.  The values are generated with an ABS clock increment of `1/4`, which corresponds to 6 hours with the chosen scaling factor.
