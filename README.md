# ABS Examples [![Build Status]

This repository contains a collection of ABS examples that are used in
different contexts.

The directory `/qa` contains a unit test that you should add your files(s) to. Run the test from the commandline to make sure that your example is well-formed with `ant -Dfrontend=/path/to/abstools/frontend` before pushing.
