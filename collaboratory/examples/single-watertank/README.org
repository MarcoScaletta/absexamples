* The single water tank example for ABS

See https://abs-models.org/documentation/examples/single-watertank/ for a discussion of this example.

See
https://projects.au.dk/fileadmin/D3.5_Examples_Compendium_2.pdf#page=9
for a description of the scenario.

Note that the custom visualization can currently only be used by
running this example outside the collaboratory.  From a command line, run `make` in this directory to compile and start the model, then connect a browser to `http://localhost:8080/`.
